# About Serial Vault

The Serial Vault is a web service that generates signed serial assertions for devices. 
It can be run in a data centre or on premises on a factory LAN.

The Serial Vault holds a list of approved models for a manufacturer, and the encrypted 
signing key(s) for the models. The service validates the model and logs if the serial number 
and device-key fingerprint have been previously used.

Security around the SerialVault will be concerned about avoiding key or whole-system 
duplication, but it is left to the ODM/OEM to ensure physical security of the machine (theft) 
and ensuring that request to its Rest API only originate from within a trusted LAN or VPN.

The hardware specification should be industrial grade for durability, rack mountable and high 
specâ€™d to reduce lag in response time as much as reasonably possible.

It stores model information and the encrypted signing keys in a database, and can optionally 
use a TPM module as a part of the encryption process.
